### TL;DR  
Ng Infinity Craft is a **7-day prototype** inspired by Infinite Craft. Built with **Angular** and powered by **Transformers.js**, it combines the classic element-merging game with a **local, in-browser LLM** to dynamically generate new elements. Originally meant to be scrapped due to LLM quirks, a shower *aha!* moment brought it back to life. This quick experiment lacks features like saving/loading, canvas element deletion, and dark modeâ€”but itâ€™s all about pushing boundaries and having fun!

# Ng Infinity Craft ðŸŒŒ  

**Ng Infinity Craft** is the result of a **7-day challenge** to reimagine the viral **Infinite Craft** game. Built using **Angular** and leveraging **Transformers.js**, this project blends creativity with cutting-edge technology. At its heart is a **local, in-browser language model (LLM)** that dynamically generates unique elements when predefined recipes donâ€™t exist.

Initially, I didnâ€™t plan to finish this project. The quirks of working with LLMsâ€”like their tendency to *continue* text instead of inventing new ideasâ€”made me want to throw in the towel. But then, **mid-showerâ€”BOOM ðŸ’¥â€”an idea struck**! With renewed enthusiasm, I spent the remaining days polishing it into something Iâ€™m proud to share.  

### What Is Ng Infinity Craft?  
Ng Infinity Craft is a **merging game prototype** where you can drag, drop, and combine elements to create new ones. If a recipe exists, you get the expected result (e.g., Fire + Water = Steam). If not, the **LLM steps in** to create something completely uniqueâ€”and often surprising!  

### Why Was This Built?  
This project was a quick **experimental prototype**, designed to push the boundaries of local AI in gaming. No servers, no cloud dependenciesâ€”just your browser doing all the work. Itâ€™s scrappy, experimental, and unapologetically fun.  

### Whatâ€™s Included?  
- **Classic Recipes**: Combine familiar elements like Fire + Water to create Steam.  
- **AI-Generated Elements**: When no recipe exists, the LLM generates something entirely new (and sometimes chaotic).  
- **Angular-Powered UI**: Drag, drop, and merge in a smooth, responsive interface.  

### Whatâ€™s Missing?  
As a **7-day challenge**, some features didnâ€™t make it in:  
- **Saving and Loading**: Your creations vanish when the tab closes.  
- **Canvas Element Deletion**: You can only clear the entire canvas at once.  
- **Dark Mode**: The light theme is here to stay (for now).  

### Why Does It Exist?  
This project is about experimentation and having fun with tech. Itâ€™s a little chaotic, a bit wild, and fully embraces the joy of discovery. So go aheadâ€”**merge, create, and see what happens**!
