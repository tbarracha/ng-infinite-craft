### TL;DR  
Ng Infinity Craft is a **prototype element-merging game** inspired by Infinite Craft. Built with **Angular** and powered by **Transformers.js**, it uses a **local, in-browser LLM** to generate new elements when predefined recipes don't exist. Originally a scrappy experiment (almost abandoned due to LLM quirks), it was revived after a shower *aha!* moment. This work-in-progress lacks saving/loading, canvas element deletion, and dark modeâ€”but hey, it's all about experimentation, chaos, and having fun!

**Ng Infinity Craft** is where curiosity meets chaos! Inspired by the viral **Infinite Craft** game, this project started as a quick experiment to see if I could merge AI creativity with cutting-edge tech. Built using **Angular** and powered by **Transformers.js**, it takes the classic element-merging concept to the next level with a **local, in-browser language model (LLM)**. Thatâ€™s rightâ€”no servers, no limits, just your browser and infinite possibilities.  

This wasnâ€™t supposed to be anything big. In fact, I almost scrapped the whole thing. Why? Because working with LLMs felt like trying to train a squirrel to bake a pieâ€”fun to watch, but not exactly what I needed. These models love to *continue* stories instead of inventing something new. It was frustrating, to say the least.  

Then, mid-showerâ€”BOOM ðŸ’¥â€”an idea hit me! I came back, polished it up, and turned it into something thatâ€™s, dare I say, pretty awesome. Let me break it down for you:  

### What Is Ng Infinity Craft?  
Ng Infinity Craft is a **merging game prototype** that reimagines the Infinite Craft experience. You drag, drop, and combine elements to create new ones. Got a predefined recipe? Youâ€™re golden. Donâ€™t? The **LLM steps in to create something completely unique**, and sometimes hilariously weird.  

### Why Should You Care?  
This isnâ€™t just a game; itâ€™s a wild experiment with **local AI-powered gameplay**. No cloud servers, no data leaksâ€”just your browser doing all the heavy lifting. Itâ€™s fun, fast, and occasionally absurd.  

### Whatâ€™s Included?  
- **Classic Recipes**: Combine Fire + Water to create Steam. Easy peasy.  
- **AI-Generated Elements**: When no recipe exists, the LLM cooks up something fresh (and sometimes chaotic).  
- **Angular-Powered UI**: Smooth, snappy, and intuitive. Drag, drop, merge, repeat.  

### But Wait, Thereâ€™s Moreâ€¦ Or Not  
This project is a **work-in-progress prototype**, and yes, itâ€™s missing a few things:  
- **Saving and Loading**: If you close the tab, itâ€™s game over for your creations.  
- **Canvas Element Deletion**: Made a mess? Your only option is to clear the whole thing.  
- **No Dark Mode**: Your retinas will have to deal with the light mode vibes.  

### Why Does It Exist?  
Letâ€™s be realâ€”this is about having fun, trying something new, and seeing how far you can push the boundaries of tech. Itâ€™s scrappy, a little wild, and totally unapologetic. If youâ€™re here, youâ€™re part of the experiment. So go ahead: **merge, create, and maybe even break it a little**. After all, the best discoveries happen when things go off-script.
